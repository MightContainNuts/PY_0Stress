        <h1>Greetings ! </h1><h1></h1>
            



<p>My name is Dean. I&#8217;m an ex-pat, living for the past 30(+) years in various towns, cities and counties of Germany.</p>



<p>I first came to Germany in 1987 on a posting with the Royal Engineers to a town in Lower Saxony called Hameln (aka Hamelin &#8211; the Pied Piper town).</p>



<p>After several years with the British Army, civilian life was calling &#8211; I left the Army in &#8217;94 (8yrs and 24 days served), went back to college, learned German, went to college/university to get some higher education qualifications (in German) and find a job as a computer aided designer in the automobile branch in Munich, Bavaria.</p>



<p>Various jobs and life changes later, I&#8217;m living in a very quiet, remote town in Sachsen Anhalt &#8211; very close to the Geiseltalsee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m enjoying working remote from my upstairs office and love the piece and quiet with my wife, 2 dogs and 2 cats (which sounds contradictory, but isn&#8217;t)</p>



<p>For more info about me &#8211; you can check my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dean-didion-b20a94ba/">linkedin</a> profile or follow me on Twitter (@mightcontainuts) (although, be warned &#8211; I&#8217;m not that super active)</p>



<p>This page is a collection of thoughts, ideas, projects and just plain nonsense&nbsp;</p>
